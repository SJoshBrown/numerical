Recursive block matrix multiplication implemented in python 2.7.

This script takes 3 arguments.

1.  Input file A
2.  Input file B
3.  Output file

Ex:  python rbmm.py inputA.txt inputB.txt out.txt

It reads in one matrix each from files A and B multiplies them and outputs the
result to the output file.
